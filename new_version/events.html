						<h3 class ="whitedetail">INDIAN YOUTH AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES TODAY</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>An interactive session on “Indian Youth and Social Challenges Today” was organized by NSS, IIT Roorkee, on 8th August, 2013 at the Convocation Hall, IIT Roorkee. The guest lecturer, Dr. Kiran Bedi, an Indian Social Activist and retired IPS officer, primarily focused on the problems faced by the youth and suggested solutions to alleviate them. Dr. Kiran Bedi first visited ANUSHRUTI at 11 am. She was apprised of the social initiative of IIT Roorkee aiming to impart special education to the handicapped deaf children on modern and scientific basis. It was followed by her special address to the volunteers of NSS, IIT Roorkee at 3 pm in which she stressed on the need to ‘Think Globally and Act Locally’. It was followed by her meeting with ASMITA members along with the Director, IIT Roorkee, Dr. Pradipta Banerji. The meeting continued till 5pm after which she headed for her guest lecture on “INDIAN YOUTH AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES TODAY” in the convocation hall along with Director Sir and Dean of Student’s Welfare, Prof. Ravi Bhushan. 
						</p>
						<p>The lecture started with the stress on “Leadership with a Conscience” especially in a large society like India’s where in by 2020, population of youth will exceed that of Americas’. A solution was proposed, to improve the present scenario, which was the introduction of a separate subject called “Conscience” through which the students will learn to live in a conscious way in the corporate world they will face, once they are mature and older. “Listen to the voice of your soul and judge what is right or wrong”, insisted Dr. Bedi. It was also suggested that we keep a track of our insecurities, fears which will shape us in a disciplined way. An oath was taken that the youth will warn the present corrupt that the future isn’t theirs. The convocation hall was brimming with energy and enthusiasm to witness the enlightening lecture by one of the stalwart’s of our country. The lecture was followed by a Q&A session where issues like that of Durga Shakti Nagpal were discussed. Dr. Kiran Bedi had a firm belief that the 450 million youth population of our country has the potential to overtake any prevalent superpower and it now lies in our hands to fulfill her dreams and steer our country towards the path of glory. The session ended with a vote of thanks from Dr. Smita Jha, Program Officer, NSS, IIT Roorkee. The evening was wrapped up by the National Anthem and the students were filled with patriotism in their hearts and redefined goals in their minds as they left the Convocation Hall.

						<h3 class ="whitedetail">PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>The NSS team of IIT Roorkee organized a guest lecture on personality development by Sri Sainath a member of the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Trust on 18th September in the New Lecture Hall Complex. The programme commenced with the welcome address by Animesh Sinha, Joint Secretary, NSS(Off Campus). The event was graced by the presence of Mrs. Smita Jha, NSS Program Officer. Sri Sainath addressed a packed audience on the leadership qualities required to develop one’s personality. Character, commitment, courage and humility are some important qualities a leader should possess. He said that the best leaders in the world were also excellent followers and understood the importance of listening. Also, good leaders are humble enough to seek help when needed. Sri Sainath emphasized on the difference between a good leader and a great leader. In his opinion, “A great leader is for himself while a good leader is for others.”He suggested the following steps to become a good leader-To be. To see. To do. To tell. During the programme, Sri Sainath quizzed the students on their views on the presentation. The students participated enthusiastically in the question and answer session. At the end, Sri Sainath tickled the minds with an interesting riddle. The take home message of the tale was –“What is visible to the eyes, may not be truth always. So we should not judge people according to what we see because there may be more to a situation than that meets the eye." Vote of thanks was given by Mrs. Smita Jha. She asked the students to try and inculcate the qualities of a leader in them because, indeed, they are the future leaders of the country

						<h3 class ="whitedetail">GENDER SENSITIZATION WORKSHOP</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>A workshop was organized by NSS, IIT Roorkee in co-ordination with ‘People For Parity’, an NGO, on 22nd September 2013, with the noble aim of educating the “educated” mass of the society on the burning national issue of ‘Gender Discrimination and Female Empowerment’. Around 250 students registered for the workshop out of which 200 were able to attend it. Two sessions of the workshop were organised, first in morning from 9:30am to 12:30 in noon and the second in afternoon from 2:00pm to 5:00pm at the Yoga Hall, Saraswati Mandir in the campus. The event started with a formal introduction of “People For Parity” and then the attendees were divided in groups, each headed by two volunteers from the organization. In order to make students understand the message organizers wanted to convey, they divided the entire time slot into various events which included group discussions, debates and fun games like Bomb-and-Shield, Bang!, Netaji-Swamiji-Gandhiji.  Workshop started with Cross Introduction, where students were to introduce their partners after few minutes of private discussion followed by funny, interesting yet meaningful games. Thereafter, they showed evocative clips that displayed the gender disparity and female dilemmas prevalent in the contemporary society. Participants were encouraged to reflect upon these issues and to share instances from their life that linked to the issue closely. Next in the series were group discussions on various real-life situations that are faced by a typical woman of the Indian society. The students actively participated in these discussions and put forward their opinions which had sharp contrasts. In the end Dr. Smita Jha, Chief Program Coordinator NSS, delivered a vote of thanks and offered a memento to the coordinator of the NGO. Best way to uplift the society is to make the society go through the various various situations and let themselves decide what should be the remedial steps, and that was the driving force behind this organization that works for the cause of parity, for the humanity.

						<h3 class ="whitedetail">MIND MATTERS</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>Life is indeed difficult, partly because of the real difficulties we must overcome in order to survive, and partly because of our own innate desire to always do better, to overcome new challenges, to self actualize. Happiness is experienced largely in striving towards a goal, not in having attained things, because our nature is always to want to go on to the next endeavour.
							Keeping these thoughts in mind, NSS IIT Roorkee in association with the Art of Living Foundation organized a Lecture cum Workshop on ‘Mind Matters’ on 12th October, 2013 at 5:00 pm. The speaker was B. Suryaprabha who has travelled across the globe to teach the Youth Empowerment and Skills (YES! +). The event was graced by the presence of Mrs. Smita Jha, NSS Program Officer.
							The event started with Prabha Ma’am asking the question “How many of you want to be successful in life?” to which each and everyone in the audience replied positively. To be 
							successful in life, she stressed upon the need of two types of skills, which are technical skills and soft skills. Since, soft skills are linked to mind and are significant to a great extent, that’s why it’s the mind that matters. Then, she expatiated on the fact that our mind works upon certain pre-formed patterns and any change in the given pattern or situation engenders struggle. She also talked of the ability to stay focussed and relaxed simultaneously which can cause wonders in professional as well as professional arena. The mind has the weirdest tendency to do what is to be resisted, thus, handling the mind becomes a herculean task. Being dubious about our own abilities is something which pulls us down and vanquishes us at every juncture of our life. So, the techniques which, ma’am stressed upon for handling mind were meditation, believing in self and above all, being natural.
							Ma’am also played several games with the audience to explain the working of mind on patterns to which the audience reciprocated with utmost enthusiasm. At last, there was a meditation session of 5-10 minutes after which Mrs. Smita Jha presented a memento to Prabha Ma’am and the workshop came to an end with an enriching experience for everybody present.

						<h3 class ="whitedetail">BLOOD DONATION CAMP</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>“The gift of blood is the gift of life”-Compliant with its noble motto of “Not for me, but for the Nation”, NSS, IIT Roorkee organised its flagship Blood Donation Camp on Sunday, 20th  October,2013 from 9 am to 5 pm. The event saw participation from three blood banks of Uttarakhand – IMA Blood Bank, Dehradun, Himalayan Jolligrant, Dehradun and Civil Hospital, Roorkee. The event was inaugurated by Dr. Pradipta Banerjee, Director, IIT Roorkee, accompanied by Dr. Ravi Bhushan, Dean of Students’ Welfare (DOSW), IIT Roorkee. The event was organised under the stewardship of Dr. Smita Jha, Program Officer, NSS, IIT Roorkee.
							Dr. Banerjee examined the necessary facilities and arrangements and enquired about the registration and screening procedure through which the donors had to undergo. He was deeply impressed by the arrangements made by the volunteers of NSS. He had words of encouragement for the donors and also interacted with the medical personnel, acknowledging their efforts.
							The IMA and Civil Hospital were allotted the student’s ward while Himalayan Jolligrant Hospital was given the family ward. The donors first got registered themselves by filling up a general questionnaire regarding their medical history which was followed by e-registrations. Thereafter, they had to undergo a screening test where their weight and blood pressure were measured and haemoglobin level was checked. The eligible donors were then issued blood bags following which they donated blood under the guidance of skilled medical staff. After donating blood, they were provided with refreshments along with certificate and a memento of appreciation.
							“Donate blood, save lives”. As Mukul Jindal, the first donor, rightly puts it “You too can be at the receiving end and may not find blood in times of need. So do good to be good”. According to Dr. Smita Jha, “It was my duty to inspire and encourage students towards such a noble cause. By donating blood, you are helping somebody”. She said that the event was a result of hard work of over 700 students, and six long months of motivation-cum-awareness programmes. According to Dr. Ravi Bhushan, “Apart from technical excellence, the students of IIT Roorkee also have a social responsibility”, and quoted “Vidya Dadati Vinayam.” He also highlighted the advantages of participating in the camp and enumerated the benefits of Blood Donor Card given to the donors, which enables one to avail blood from hospitals all across the country.
							There was all round participation, be it the NSS volunteers, the doctors or the donors themselves. Nishit Mishra, General Secretary, NSS, when asked about the preparations, explained,” The 2nd and 3rd year students motivated their 1st year counterparts towards the event, resulting in mass participation from the juniors”. Flexes were put up all across the campus and a motivational skit was organised to remove myths about blood donation on scientific, technical and emotional basis.
							The efforts yielded remarkable result, with around 800 registrations taking place and 629 units of blood sample being collected. With rapidly 
							increasing population and prevalence of diseases like dengue and malaria, the demand for blood units is rising exponentially. So, it is the need of the hour to be motivated and also motivate others to come out and be a part of this noble and virtuous initiative.

						<h3 class ="whitedetail">CLOTH DISTRIBUTION DRIVE</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>In June 2013 Uttarakhand faced the wrath of nature. A multi-day cloud burst caused devastating floods and landslides. NSS IITR organized a cloth distribution drive to donate the clothes to the victims of Uttarakhand tragedy. These were the clothes collected during the month of January 2013 from all over the campus and surrounding areas. The total clothes weighed more than 2tonnes (over 2000 kg). Although the clothes were planned to be distributed in the winter itself but the clothes collected last year were more than enough for this year’s winters. The institute was on holidays those days on account of summer vacations but the clothes were carried away to Dehradun to donate to CM’s relief fund with the help of some M.Tech and PHD scholars along with the former general secretary of NSS Mr. Arpit Mittal under the guidance of Mrs. Smita Jha, Program Officer, NSS IITR totalling to mere 13 people! The clothes were donated to the relief fund in presence of top officials like DM and SDO. It was a major achievement on the part of NSS IITR as all this was done during the holidays when no undergraduate NSS student was present in the campus and with the voluntary contribution of the Postgraduate students.

						<h3 class ="whitedetail">DISCOVERING INDIA</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>To commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, NSS IIT Roorkee organized a motivational lecture, DISCOVERING INDIA- AN IITIAN’S PERSPECTIVE, on Monday, 28th October, 2013 at Bose Auditorium, Physics Department, IIT Roorkee. Our guest lecturer, Shobhit Mathur, alumni of IIT Bombay and founder of “Youth for Seva (YFS)”– a national organization, which aims at inspiring the youth to serve mankind, took us through his life, recounting to the audience his journey of self-discovery. Dr. Smita Jha, Program Officer, NSS IIT Roorkee inaugurated the event and introduced the chief guest to the audience.
							Born and brought up in Hyderabad, Shobhit, like any other Indian kid, was fascinated by the unknown. The west was a distant realm, where dreams come true. An All India Rank of 72 in IIT-JEE ensured him a place amongst the best. After pursuing degree in Computer Science Engineering from IIT Bombay, he was admitted to University of Washington, Seattle for post-graduation. Meanwhile, the advent of Internet had opened up a plethora of opportunities exposing him to western culture. Hobbit arrived in US, star struck by the various possibilities that the west offered. His days there, however, proved to be an eye-opener for him.  The Hindu Students council, where Indian students met to discuss their views and ideas, also influenced him to a great extent. This process of self-realization led him to take off two months, prior to joining Amazon. He travelled to Surinam, an unknown country in South 
							America, with a large Indian population. Shobhit was engaged in teaching computers among the poor. But it turned out that the people expected more from him. He was regarded as an ambassador from India -the ‘holy’ land.
							Two years later, Shobhit quit his job in Amazon when he realized that it was not what he was looking for. He set out to begin a new chapter in his life. Back in India, after a stint with RIWATCH (Research Institute of World’s Ancient Traditions, Cultures and Heritage) in Arunachal Pradesh, Shobhit realized his aim in life, to help and serve the people around him. Consequently, Youth for Seva was founded in Hyderabad. He went on to explain various activities of Youth for Seva and how from just a small group of likeminded individuals, they have expanded into a national organization, with chapters in many cities all over India.
							Shobhit implored the audience to get out of the rat race and follow their calling. The question answer session that followed had the audience brimming with queries and thoughts regarding the talk. Shobhit Mathur was presented with a memento for gracing us with his presence and wisdom.The talk left the audience inspired, aware and motivated towards their goal in life.

						<h3 class ="whitedetail">INFLUENCE AND CAMPAIGN</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>With Lok Sabha Elections round the corner, NSS IITR organized a talk on “Influence and Campaigns” by Prof. Holli A. Semetko on Monday, 10th March, 2014.The event was graced by the presence of our Dy. Director Prof. S.P. Gupta, Dean of Alumni Relations, Dean of Student Welfare and Mrs. Smita Jha, NSS Program Officer. The event started with the singing of Kulgeet.
							Prof. Holli began the talk with a brief introduction about herself and her love for India. She said that she loved the fast paced rhythm of Indian life. And for a person like her who specializes in Media, India is the place to come as it has a very robust active media system, with the maximum number of English dailies and over 700 newspapers.
							She began her presentation talking about this era of accelerated change, where the use of social media has seen an exponential rise. Now China, India and USA have replaced Japan in the maximum number of internet users. She explained the difference between marketing campaigns and political campaigns. The marketing campaigns targeted consumers while political campaigns targeted supporters and potential voters but both used multimedia platform for large scale reach among the masses. She also pointed out the technological and social changes that the campaigns had undergone. The traditional sources of power had shifted from government and media to citizens, consumers and individuals. The influence of these campaigns could be measured through contact feedback and behavior change. She compared the media habits of the young generation of the European countries and India. She revealed that newspapers weren’t very popular among the youth there while in India, reading newspapers was a daily habit of the young people. She also explained the different marketing techniques of various countries.
							In the end, she talked about her Delhi election campaigns study report. The whole election campaign was difficult to monitor because of the enormity of the election campaign. She also complained about the uncooperative nature of the government authorities, who did not release data about the voting patterns. 
							After the wonderful talk by Prof. Holli, the students came up with their queries. The questions were many but the time was limited. Still, Prof. tried to answer all the questions to the best of her experience. Then, the Deputy Director presented a memento to her and the event ended with a vote of thanks by Mrs. Smita Jha. The event was an enriching experience for all of the students.

						<h3 class ="whitedetail">IMPORTANCE OF SWAMI VIVEKANANDAS PHILOSOPHY</h3>
					</div>
					<div class ="detailinfo">
						<p>Our motherland has seen countless heroes, who, with their dynamic strength of mind and soul, have registered themselves immortal forever in the pages of history. Swami Vivekananda is an epitome whose legendary personality has influenced hundreds and thousands of souls all across the globe. 
							On the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of this influential leader,a special guest lecture was organized on 25th January, 2014 by NSS, IIT Roorkee as a tribute to him. The lecture highlighted the relevance of Swami Vivekananda's philosophy in the current world scenario. His galvanizing ideology was commendably delivered by honorable chief guest, Professor T. K. Dutta from Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Delhi and attended by several enthusiastic students and professors, keen to imbibe Swami's way of life for a stronger nation.
							The lecture gave a glimpse of several aspects of Swami Vivekananda: his panoramic personality, his religious philosophy and education. A painter, a philosopher, a musician, a philanthropist; he was bestowed with an astonishingly wide array of talent. His inspiriting poems and speeches, particularly the memorable one in Chicago Religion Congress, didn't just earn admiration, but in a way, shook the world.
							Extending to this, Swami Vivekananda redefined education as manifestation of perfection and religion as the very foundation to discover the divinity within oneself. His charismatic personality and the quest for reviving the Vedantic way of life, on paths of Shri Rama Krishnan, continue to attract the youth.
							The words of wisdom speak of retaining patience and perseverance to surmount all mountains in the development of inner strength and an attitude for service. They stimulate us to quitclaim materialistic goals and step into social service to attain tranquility of mind. We hope that the commendable effort triggers a spark of change and proves to be a ladder in re-building youth power.

					<div class ="detailinfo">
							<p>NSS, IIT Roorkee organized Vimarsh, a paper presentation event held during the cultural cum youth fest, THOMSO of the institute on October 5, 2013. The event encompassed a competition which witnessed about 22 entries from various colleges across India. Seven best abstracts were short-listed for the live event on October 5. The topic given to the students was “Is Death penalty a solution for crimes against women?”
								Earlier the contestants were asked to submit an abstract of about 500 words for the short-listing. The event was presided over by MrsAnasuya Banerji as the chief guest and judge alongside MrsSmitaJha, NSS Program Officer.
								The event included presentation of the papers of the short listed candidates followed by a question-answer session. Majority of the participants were against death penalty as the solution and many alternatives were provided. Some of those alternatives include awareness, more freedom in the form of bravery to the feminine from self-defense in such situations. The opposite argument for the topic was mainly focused on the view of death penalty as a short term solution, with immediate countermeasures plausible which would eventually lead to a long term eradication of this “disease” that has struck the national shame.
								An interesting note in the course of the event was the freedom given to the audience to develop a minor debate among themselves 
								whether a long term solution or a short term solution to be taken. A conclusion from the chief guest that every problem can only be removed slowly, a short term solution could only impart fear, not a realization. So the short term solutions cannot end this problem.
								The event concluded with a vote of thanks by Mrs. Smita Jha and announcement of result by the Chief Guest.
