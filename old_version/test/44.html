Since my schooldays i had a wish of contributing somehow to the society. Various thoughts used to come in my mind like teaching the underprivileged, giving them food etc. Somewhere I read the slogan "Each one teach one" and this made a home in my heart. When I came to IITR, I got the required platform here in the form of an organization-N.S.S</p>
<p>
Here I taught children, went to surveys which brought a true picture of Indian villages in front of me. All these incidents planted a seed in the soil of my heart for Social Service.</p>
<p>
At its crude level, N.S.S, IIT Roorkee tries to help the needy and the underprivileged by providing them education, giving them knowledge about new technology, organizing Cloth Distribution  activities, performing Nukkad Nataks for motivating the poor as well as the students, creating awareness on issues like Pollution, wastage of resources,etc. on one hand
and at the same time instilling the seeds of Patriotism, Social Service in the young bright minds of India which would represent the future of India. Even if we succeed in making half students realize their responsibility towards the Nation, it would be a satisfactory achievement for us in long term .</p>
<p>
N.S.S spreading the message of "NOT FOR ME BUT FOR THE NATION" among the youth brings a ray of hope into the society.

  <p>In today's world most of us are so very consumed in our own matters that we hardly bother to look at the poor and destitute 's plight. Satisfying our professional and emotional needs are the only things that matter to us. Given a chance a lot would prefer spending time watching a movie rather than helping someone in the attempt to reclaim his life.</p>
  <p>
    We enjoy the comforts of life but the unfortunate ones cannot afford a 3 time meal. In winters we sit cosily and enjoy the weather but those on the street try hard just to survive. We wear thick Nike, Adidas, Reebok jackets and try to show off to the world whereas those on the streets are devoid of simple quilts to keep themselves warm.

    <p>
    Have you not had those days when you were in dire need of help and someone came to your rescue? For a college student just someone helping him to complete a tutorial/question bank at the very last moment means a lot. But this is life, much bigger,  more cruel. The pleasure that you derive by helping someone is unquantifiable. Happiness is not quantifiable, it doesn't come by the figures you have in your bank account but is rather a qualitative term.</p>
    
    <p> It is my firm belief that life is like a diary with numbered pages, so fill each page with such memory so that when diary ends, there are things worth remembering! </p>
