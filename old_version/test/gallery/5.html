				<h3>Orientation</h3>
				<p>NSS, IIT Roorkee is an organisation that aims at producing engineers, who are socially responsible and act as an asset to the nation by contributing towards the betterment of the society. NSS is a platform, where you set the stage for others to stand up for the less privileged. Our motto, ‘not for me, but for the nation’ reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for self-less service. Currently, we have about 700 students working actively on various aspects of social service, such as community health care, awareness campaigns, rural transformation, blood donation camps and organisation of educational lectures. The students of IITR, with the support of faculty advisors give their best to contribute to the betterment of the society. In this newsletter, we bring to you our initiatives and their strong, albeit local impacts.
